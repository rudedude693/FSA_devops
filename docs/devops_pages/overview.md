Tips, tricks and tools for working with Fullstack Academy AI/ML boot camp course content.

## 1. Cloud development environments

### 1.1. Vocareum

You don't need to set anything up to get started with Vocareum. Just follow the link from Canvas and it will land you in a cloud virtual machine that is ready to go. You can save and submit your work by downloading notebook files to your computer.

If you want to save your Vocareum code to GitHub, you can set that up - but it's not required. See [Tracking Vocareum environments on GitHub](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/devops_pages/vocareum.html).

### 1.2. GitHub Codespaces

On any Github repo, click the green 'Code' dropdown button, then from the Codespaces tab, click the green 'Create codespace on main' button. GitHub will spin up a cloud virtual machine for you that already has git and and VS code and is pre-populated with the code from the repository you started the codespace on. Neat!

The first 120 hours of codespace time per month is free - after that, GitHub will lock you out unless you pay. Here are the [pricing details](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces)

### 1.3. Google CoLab

Google Colab is another fully-managed Cloud option. Visit the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) site while logged into a Google account and you will find yourself in a Jupyter notebook-like interface, ready to code. You can pull Jupyter notebooks directly from GitHub with a URL, or upload them from your local machine.

Another good perk of Colab is it will give you some limited NVIDIA T4 GPU access for free.

### 1.4. Kaggle notebooks

Coming soon - yet another [fully managed Jupyter notebook environment](https://www.kaggle.com/code) with some free GPU compute available.

## 2. Local development environments

### 2.1. Linux

Linux is my OS of choice and I'm going to assume that if you installed linux on your computer and are using to attend Zoom meetings, you are probably comfortable setting up git, a current version of Python and VS Code. If you get stuck, let me know!

### 2.2. MacOS

See [Setting up your macOS development environment](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/devops_pages/macos.html)

### 2.3. Windows

See [Setting up your Windows development environment](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/devops_pages/windows.html)
